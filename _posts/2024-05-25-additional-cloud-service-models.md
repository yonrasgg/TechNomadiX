While Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are the most common cloud models, businesses now have access to a range of specialized cloud services tailored to specific needs. These models provide flexible, scalable solutions without requiring significant investment in infrastructure. This post delves into emerging cloud models, such as Security as a Service (SECaaS), Storage as a Service (STaaS), and Network as a Service (NaaS), along with the comprehensive X as a Service (XaaS) approach.

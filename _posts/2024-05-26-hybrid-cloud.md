The **hybrid cloud** model is a cloud computing architecture that integrates both public and private clouds, allowing organizations to manage specific resources and applications with greater control while still benefiting from the scalability of the public cloud. Defined by NIST as the combination of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private and public), the hybrid cloud aims to optimize resource allocation and efficiency.

## What is a Hybrid Cloud?

A **hybrid cloud** combines the strengths of both public and private cloud models. For instance, a company may choose to deploy non-critical applications in the public cloud, taking advantage of its scalability and cost efficiency, while hosting critical data and applications in a private cloud to ensure maximum security and control. This hybrid setup provides an ideal balance for organizations seeking both flexibility and security.

### Hybrid Cloud Models

| **Hybrid Cloud Deployment Models**                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Separate public and private cloud providers                      |
| - Single provider offering both public and private cloud options   |
| - Self-managed private cloud combined with third-party public cloud|

### Characteristics of Hybrid Cloud

1. **Scalability**: The hybrid cloud leverages the virtually unlimited scalability of the public cloud for non-critical functions, while reserving the private cloud for critical tasks.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: By balancing resource usage across public and private clouds, hybrid clouds can reduce operational costs while maintaining secure infrastructure.
3. **Security**: Private cloud components ensure that critical data is stored securely, meeting regulatory standards for data privacy and control.
4. **Flexibility**: With access to both public and private resources, hybrid cloud users can adjust their configurations to meet changing needs without compromising data integrity or accessibility.

### Example Use Cases

- **E-commerce Platform**: A business might use a private cloud for managing financial transactions, while utilizing a public cloud for customer information storage and product catalogs, where security demands are lower.
- **Financial Services**: Sensitive customer data can be stored on a private cloud, while project planning and collaboration files are accessed through a public cloud, allowing for secure and efficient team collaboration.

|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enhanced Security for Critical Operations**       | **Complex Management**: Integrating two cloud models can be complex |
| **Cost Savings** through selective cloud usage      | **Compatibility Issues** may arise between cloud components      |
| **Resource Optimization**                           | **Security Risks** if integration is not managed properly        |
| **Regulatory Compliance** for sensitive data        | **Dependency on Internet** for public cloud accessibility        |

The hybrid cloud model provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for organizations that require both scalability and security. By combining public and private cloud resources, companies can optimize their operations, keeping critical data secure while benefiting from the elasticity of public cloud resources. For organizations navigating complex data requirements and fluctuating workloads, the hybrid cloud model offers a balanced, adaptable approach to cloud computing.

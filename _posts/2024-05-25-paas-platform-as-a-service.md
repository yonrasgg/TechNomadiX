## Potential Drawbacks of PaaS

| Drawback                   | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract Duration**      | PaaS contracts are often long-term, leading to higher dependency on the provider.                                                                       |
| **Limited Tool Options**   | Many PaaS platforms offer a restricted set of development tools, which can limit flexibility for advanced or unique application requirements.            |
| **Provider Dependency**    | Migrating to a new provider can be challenging, as tools and configurations may not be compatible across different PaaS services, complicating transitions. |

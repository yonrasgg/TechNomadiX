Detective controls are an integral component of any robust security and governance framework, especially within cloud infrastructures like AWS. These controls help in identifying and mitigating security threats by providing visibility into actions and activities across your cloud resources. This blog post will guide you through the essential aspects of detective controls in AWS, focusing on AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, auditing capabilities, and services such as Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Config. We will explore each of these in detail from a DevOps and programmerâ€™s perspective to help you understand their applications and best practices.

## *Capturing and Collecting Logs*

The core of detective controls in AWS revolves around effectively capturing and collecting logs. AWS offers services like **AWS CloudTrail** and **Amazon CloudWatch** to assist in this regard.

### AWS CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail is crucial for tracking changes made to AWS resources through API calls. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS console actions, command-line tools, and automated services. Below is a sample of a CloudTrail log that provides insight into user activity.

```json
{
    "Records": [{
        "eventVersion": "1.0",
        "userIdentity": {
            "type": "IAMUser",
            "principalId": "EX_PRINCIPAL_ID",
            "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice",
            "accountId": "123456789012",
            "accessKeyId": "EXAMPLE_KEY_ID",
            "userName": "Alice"
        },
        "eventTime": "2018-03-06T21:01:59Z",
        "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
        "eventName": "StopInstances",
        "awsRegion": "us-west-2",
        "sourceIPAddress": "205.251.233.176",
        "userAgent": "ec2-api-tools 1.6.12.2",
        "requestParameters": {
            "instancesSet": {
                "items": [{
                    "instanceId": "i-ebeaf9e2"
                }
            },
            "force": false
        },
        "responseElements": {
            "instancesSet": {
                "items": [{
                    "instanceId": "i-ebeaf9e2",
                    "currentState": {
                        "code": 64,
                        "name": "stopping"
                    },
                    "previousState": {
                        "code": 16,
                        "name": "running"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This log allows you to pinpoint actions taken, the user performing them, and the resource affected. Such logs are critical for auditing and understanding the scope of changes during troubleshooting and compliance reviews.

## *Monitoring and Notifications with Amazon CloudWatch*

Detective controls are also about monitoring your environment in real time and responding to incidents swiftly. Amazon CloudWatch plays a significant role in ensuring effective monitoring by capturing metrics, logs, and events across AWS services.

### Amazon CloudWatch Components

| **Component**       | **Description**                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![CloudWatch Agent]({{ 'assets/img/aws-cloudwatch-icon-452x512-sllbm3uc.png' | relative_url }}) | **CloudWatch Agent**: Used for communication between EC2 instances and CloudWatch. Logs from on-premises or cloud servers are monitored and analyzed for patterns or unexpected behaviors. |
| ![CloudWatch Events]({{ 'assets/img/aws-cloudwatch-icon-452x512-sllbm3uc.png' | relative_url }}) | **CloudWatch Events**: Delivers real-time system events and can route them to AWS services. For example, creating a snapshot of an EBS volume or triggering alarms for action. |
| ![AWS Lambda for Remediation]({{ 'assets/img/images (1).png' | relative_url }}) | **AWS Lambda for Remediation**: Functions are triggered to automatically handle failed security checks, thus ensuring compliance without manual intervention. |
| ![CloudWatch Alarms]({{ 'assets/img/images (1).png' | relative_url }}) | **CloudWatch Alarms**: Triggers based on metrics like CPU utilization. For instance, when an instance fails a status check, an alarm can initiate recovery via Lambda. |
| ![Amazon SNS for Notifications]({{ 'assets/img/aws-sns-simple-notification-service-icon-2044x2048-9q71lm44.png' | relative_url }}) | **Amazon SNS for Notifications**: Manages and delivers messages when alarms are triggered, ensuring that key stakeholders are notified of critical changes. |
